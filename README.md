The Weather Dashboard uses an API from Openweathermap.org [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to present the user with a 5 day forcast when entering their city and state.  The Weather Dashboard also saves to their local storage city and state weather forecasts they have viewed in the past.
